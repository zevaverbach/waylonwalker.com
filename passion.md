## Follow Your Passion

_my journey into data science_

In January 2018 I started work as a full time data scientist turning my passion into a career.  It is something that I didn't see myself doing 5 years ago, but is something that I love to do.  It combines my love of data, visualization, story telling, software development, and writing code.  Most of all it allows me to work in a space that promotes learning and creativity.  As a mechanical engineer for a company that has been building equipment for nearly a century the mechanical engineering is very well established I felt that there was not a lot of room for creativity.
