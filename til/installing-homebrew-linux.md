Installing brew on linux proved quite easy and got pyenv running for me
within 4 commands.

I had never used homebrew before, honestly I thought it was a mac only
thing for years.  Today I wanted to try out pyenv, and the reccommended
way to install was using homebrew.  I am not yet sure if I want either
in my normal workflow, so for now I am just going to pop open a new
terminal and install homebrew and see how it goes.


``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/walkers/.zprofile
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

That was it, now homebrew is working. Starting a new shell and running
the command to install pyenv worked.

``` bash
brew install pyenv
```
