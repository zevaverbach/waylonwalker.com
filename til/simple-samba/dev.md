title: Simple Samba Share Setup
---

Samba is an implementation of the smb protocol that allows me to setup network shares on my linux machine that I can open on a variety of devices.

I think the homelab is starting to intrigue me enought to dive into the path of experimenting with different things that I might want setup in my own home. One key piece of this is network storage.  As I looked into nas, I realized that it takes a dedicated machine, or one virtualized at a lower level than I have capability for right now.


## Humble Beginnings

To get goind I am going to make a directory `/srv/samba/public` open to anyone on my network.  I am not going to worry too much about it, I just want something up and running so that I can learn.

Install samba, open the firewall, and edit the `smb.conf`
```
sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin sudo ufw allow samba sudo nvim /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

I added this to the end of my `smb.conf`

```
[public]

comment = public share, no need to enter username and password path = /srv/samba/public/ browseable = yes writable = yes guest ok = yes
```

Then I made the `/srv/samba/public` directory and made it writable by anyone.

```
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/public sudo setfacl -R -m "u:nobody:rwx" /srv/samba/public/
```

## Windows, yes windows

I have a windows desktop in my office, primarily for my wife to run premiere pro, and my son to play Minecraft.  I walked over to it, opened the file explorer, and ernt to `\\<my-local-ip>`.  It asked for the username and password, I typed in the username and password of the linux device I have the share running on, and I was in.  Right there I could see the Public folder.  I opened it and made a files successfully.
