title: Mixing Colors at the Command Line
---

From the same Author that brought us command line essentials like `fd` and
`bat` written in rust comes [pastel](https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel) an
incredible command-line tool to generate, analyze, convert and manipulate colors.

## Install

You can install from one of the [releases](https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel/releases), follow the [instructions](https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel#installation) for your system from the repo.  I chose to go the nix route.  I have enjoyed the simplicity of the nix package manager being cross platform and have very up  to date packages in it.

```bash
nix-env --install pastel
```

## Mixing colors

Something I often do to blend colors together is add a little alpha to something over top of a background.  I can simulate this by mixing colors.

```bash
pastel color cornflowerblue | pastel mix goldenrod -f .1
```

Here is one from the docs that show how you can generate a color palette from random colors, mix in some red, lighten and format all in one pipe.

```bash
pastel random | pastel mix red | pastel lighten 0.2 | pastel format hex
```

## color picker

I am on Ubuntu 20.10 as I write this and it works flawlessly.  When I call the command, a color picker gui pops up along with an rgb panel.  I can pick from the panel or from anywhere on my screen.

```bash
pastel color-picker
```

## Conversions

I often will want to convert a color from rgb to hex or hsl vice versa.  I open google and search.  This is one part that I could really use adding to my workflow.

## Check it

Here I can mix up a dark grey with rgb, mix in 20% cornflowerblue, and grab the hex value.

```bash
pastel color 50,50,50 | pastel mix cornflowerblue -f .2
```

I really want to get this into my workflow.  I saw it quite awhile ago but have not done much color work.  Lately I have been doing a bit more front end, and have been getting into game development.  This is the time to stop googling random color mixers and use this one.
