One thing about moving to a tiling window manager like awesome wm or i3 is that they are so lightweight they are all missing things like bluetooth gui's out of the box, and you generally bring your own.  Today I just needed to connet a new set of headphones, so I decided to just give the `bluetoothctl` cli a try.  It seems to come with Ubuntu, I don't think I did anything to get it.

``` bash
bluetoothctl
```

Running `bluetoothctl` pops you into a repl/shell like bah, python, or ipython. From here you can execute `bluetoothctl` commands.


Here is what I had to do to connect my headphones.

``` bash
# list out the commands available
help

# scan for new devices and stop when you see your device show up
scan on scan off

# list devices
devices paired-devices

# pair the device
pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# now your device should show up in the paired list
paired-devices

# connet the device
connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

## help

Here is the output of the help menu on my machine, it seems pretty straight forward to block, and remove devices from here.

note ctrl revers to the bluetooth controller on the machine you are on, and dev refers to a device id.

## Final Impressions

This was something that I have never used, and thought it would be intimidating but it worked great first try out of the box.  It could have been my device on the other end, but this was one of the least frustrations I have had pairing a new device.
