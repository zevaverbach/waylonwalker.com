# Story

I can still rememember the day that we we realized our new baby girl had gone days without a bowel movement.  Holding her while she looked as if she was about to pop at any moment, completely nervous for what was to come.  

Little did we know what that strong little girl had in store for us.  She was perparing us for something much bigger.  Little did we know how much scary medical journeys would soon become a "normal" part of our life.  We spent two solid years fighting for this girl every day.

I still remember that Fall day.  That day you drove my car home alone while I sat with our kids, patiently awaiting your arrival.  When you arrived, no words needed to be spoken, the minute you opened the car door I knew our lives had changed forever.

Scared out of our minds we held it together the best we could for those two kids we were holding.  Fast forward 6 weeks, you are recovering from the biggest surgery of your life, and we notice that little girl is now feeding enough for herself. No longer in need of the feeding pump the g-tube.  No longer in need to wear a backpack with constant feed.  

All along she was preparing us for something much bigger, soemthing we could not have imagined, something we could not have taken without the training she had given us.

Together we are stronger after the battles we have faced.  The long battles we have won.  Stronger than ever we are ready for anything.


# Promise

I promise to stay strong and grow with you.

I promise to hold your hand through the scary moments and tell you everything will be ok.  We will find a solution, we always do.

I will check the house in the middle of the night when there are noises no matter how tired I am.  I know that it causes you really strong feelings that you cannot shake until its been checked.

I promise to sit by your side when you are down, no matter how many times we re-watch Big Bang Theory it will never be too much.

# support

I will accept support on my bad days.  I know that I try to be the rock of the family and push until I cannot push anymore, no matter how much you tell me to rest.  I really do appreciate when you take notice that things are going harder than normal.

I will accept your coaching in handling social emotional issues that are hard for me to understand on my own.
