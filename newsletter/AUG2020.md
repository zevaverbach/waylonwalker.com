It's been quite a busy Month and a half since my last official newsletter With about 14 individual posts going live since then.  I pushed hard over the past two weeks and just made a lot of content about things that I actually do.  Many of these were things that I know quite well and were quite quick to write.  I really enjoyed putting them out there and seeing all of the comments and feedback roll in.

## Highlights

### [Integration testing with Python, TestProject.io, and GitHub Actions](https://waylonwalker.com/testproject-io-py-actions/)

I learned the most from this post.  It's been awhile since I had done any testing with selenium and I wanted to brush up on those skills for some upcoming work.  I chose to test my own website, run it on github actions and use TestProject for reporting.

### [Creating Reusable Bash Scripts](https://waylonwalker.com/reusable-bash/)

I've been writing a ton of bash scripts lately.  In this article I write down a few of the things that I have recently learned to make my scripts just a bit better.

### [🤓 What's on your GitHub Profile](https://dev.to/waylonwalker/what-s-on-your-github-profile-40p3)

GitHub profiles were released recently and I asked on DEV.to "Whats on your GitHub Profile".  This was a discussion that turned out some incredible response.  There are so many great profiles posted in the discussion section.  Check them out for inspiration on yours.

### [🔥 How to crush amazing posts on DEV](https://dev.to/waylonwalker/how-to-crush-amazing-posts-on-dev-4cgh)

This post was super fun to write.  It's specifically for writing DEV.to posts, but is generally useful to any medium length content that sits between a tweet and a book.  I definitly learned a few things during research and in the discussion.  I have picked up a few tricks that make my posts a bit easier to scan and get a bit better engagement than having a wall of text.

* [Black Tech Pipeline](https://waylonwalker.com/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline/)

    I was particularly inspired by @chantastic episode 103 of the react podcast with @ParissAthena. They spoke about the black tech pipeline as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Pariss is quite an inspiration. She has done so much work to create a better place for POC in tech. I like that not only is she helping them get jobs but acting as a mentor for their first few months on the job to make sure that they are able to find their place and fit in.

* [🐍 Practice Python Online](https://waylonwalker.com/practice-python-online/)

    When learning a new skill it's important to practice along the way. In order for me to show up to practice I need to make it easy to show up. An easy way to show up to practice with python is to use an online repl. With these you can try out something quick. Sometimes I see snippets from blogs or tweets and I need to try the out for myself to really understand.

* [Why use a cms](https://waylonwalker.com/why-use-cms/)

    When first learning to code its very common to hard code everything right into the code. This happens with most folks in just about any language. Whether its html or markdown for front end content, or even hardcoding parameters in our backend languages like python, or node.js.

* [🐍 Parsing RSS feeds with Python](https://waylonwalker.com/parsing-rss-python/)

    I am looking into a way to replace my google reader experience that I had back in 2013 before google took it from us. I am starting by learning how to parse feeds with python, and without much previous knowledge it proved to be much easier than anticipated thanks to the `feedparser` library.
