Today I really tried to shift focus to on the kids.  It's been a wild ride this year and I have really been stuck in the motions, wake up, get kids food, work, get Rhiannon meds, work, get food, .... all the utilitarian things that we all need day in and day out.  Then vacation hit and all the extra time was on cleaning and holiday things.  It was hard to just use the extra time to do fun things with them that we normally have not been doing.

This morning Wyatt and I finished Wally his robot dog.  It was so cute, and he loved it.  Honestly the kit was super cool, complicated, and the directions were only mostly there.  It turned into a lot of can you find A15 for me, do you want to cut it, thank you, this is where I am going to put it.  He loved watchig it come together, but I could feel that it was too much for him to do, even with help.

In the afternoon we went out to the front and went skating/bike riding. Everyone did great, and Ayla made some really good improvements on riding her bike uphill.  She was making it uphill with less and less help each time.

Finally after supper Wyatt Ayla and I all built things in scratch.  Ayla sang the most beautiful song, and I animated the ballerina that she picked out to sing her song.  Then Wyatt made a Dream Character move and fight a boss, he drew a custom sword, and I make it so the sword followed dream.

Just tryin to make the best of the holidays
