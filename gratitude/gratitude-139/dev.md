title: Gratitude 139

Today Ayla was quarantined in her room after having a sick evening yesterday. She seems to be doing great overall today, no more symptoms.  I completely expect tomorrow to be back to normal.  We set her up with all sorts of fun activities and meals in her room.  We even gave her one of our Alexas so that she could drop into my office anytime that she needed.  She would drop in, tell me jokes, and all about the things she was up to.  Overall I am very impressed with how well she did today.  She is so good with all of these kind of things.

Oh and I would drop by with dobby at the door each time we needed to go out for a puppy peek to help us feel better, it would bring the biggest smile to her face each time.
