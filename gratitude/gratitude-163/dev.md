Do you ever wish that you could just get through to someone, try to get them to understand your side?  Right now I would really like to know how to explain to my family what my wife means to me. The mother of our children.  My best friend for as long as I can remember, the only friend I've really had any where near this long in my life.

On the flip side, I would also really like to try to understand their side.  I think I know, but its so damn foreign to me that it just makes no sense.  I feel we just have very similarly opposing feelings there, just not understanding where the other is coming from.  It all feels so rediculous, but every day, every big event I feel like I just loose a bit more of them.  It make me feel sad.
