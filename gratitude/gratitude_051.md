#### Talking

Today I am grateful for the fact that I have someone to talk about my problems with.  Rhiannon is very influential when it comes to mental health.   She has conconcoured several very difficult issues of her own and is able to guide me through mine.  I am glad that we are able to talk through these things and come up with actionable things to correct.

Life remains a rollar coaster and these issues will come  and go, new ones will rise and fall, old ones will creep in.  It is important to keep someone like this who you can talk to.  For me it is **very** difficult to identify what the root issue is to begin with let alone try to fix it.  Recently I was really struggling and it came down to confidence/imposter syndrome.  She was able to identify that, and point out some really amazing feedback that I have recieved as truth that I am achieving great standards, even if I dont feel that way when I am lost in the weeds of everything.
