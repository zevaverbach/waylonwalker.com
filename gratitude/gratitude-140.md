HUGE SNOW DAY.  Today we got one of the biggest snows we have had since moving
to Illinois nearly 10 years ago.  The one that feels close was the first year
we were here, the day Becca came to see us in Minier we got dumped on.  I
remember calling in that day and the response was well, if you don't think you
can make it you can use a vacation day.... it was my first year and my very
little vacation was pro-rated.  Oh what different times we are in now!

Rhiannon scooped the drive... well she hired it out.  I am so grateful for her
doing that, because as I watched neighbors snowblow their driveways I realized
how back breaking shoveling would have been.

While everyone else way blowing off their drives after work Wyatt and I were
enjoying the fruits of Rhiannon's hard work.  We made a really awesome igloo in
the pile of snow that turned into a tunnel through the pile.  He was super
impressed and was had a ton of fun playing it.
