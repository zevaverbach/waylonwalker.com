#### Good Tunes

Recently the kids have really been into singing in the car with Daddy on the way to and from Preshool.  It is so fun, because we are all belting it out so loud, and each take over for our special parts.  It's interesting how Ayla has grown into liking it.  For the longest time I thought that she did not like Wyatt and I being so loud, but she never complained about it.  Then over the past week I noticed during some parts of the songs she is the **LOUDEST** one in the car.  After each song the kids both ask, "Did I sing the whole song?", and I try to get super into it and have a very motivational Radio DJ style of voice encouraging them to continue and tell them how well they did.
