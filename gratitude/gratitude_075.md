article_html: "<h4 id=\"calm\">Calm</h4>\n<p>We are tired, short on sleep, bodies
  tired from lifting, but we remain high on the excitement of what is to come.  We
  are pushing through day by day to ensure that we meet our deadlines.  Our kids are
  missing the amount of time that we play with them, and starting to struggle emotionally,
  heck I think we are all struggling emotionally.  We have packed everything we own
  into a truck ready to move to a new place.  All of our favorite things are packed
  in, not surrounding us, and not giving us the compfort that we are used to.  This
  has been our life over the past week.  Now we take a deep breath and appreciate
  all of the help we have recieved this week.  The help that we recieved from our
  friends, to the landlords, my coworkers, and most of all each other.  Our favorite
  things are starting to surround us in our new place.  We have room, and time, to
  play.  Some things are not yet set up, but enough is setup to breathe.  Let's embrace
  the <strong>calm</strong> as we roll into the final phase of this move.</p>\n<div

#### Calm

We are tired, short on sleep, bodies tired from lifting, but we remain high on the excitement of what is to come.  We are pushing through day by day to ensure that we meet our deadlines.  Our kids are missing the amount of time that we play with them, and starting to struggle emotionally, heck I think we are all struggling emotionally.  We have packed everything we own into a truck ready to move to a new place.  All of our favorite things are packed in, not surrounding us, and not giving us the compfort that we are used to.  This has been our life over the past week.  Now we take a deep breath and appreciate all of the help we have recieved this week.  The help that we recieved from our friends, to the landlords, my coworkers, and most of all each other.  Our favorite things are starting to surround us in our new place.  We have room, and time, to play.  Some things are not yet set up, but enough is setup to breathe.  Let's embrace the **calm** as we roll into the final phase of this move.
