Brisket night!  We had a fantastic Brisket delivered to us by Butcher Box, and everyone absolutely loved it.  Ayla was so skeptical, that it was kinda funny.  she went from "ew, I don't want that", to "Maybe I'll try some", to "YES give me some", to "Can I have MORE!".

We all seem to be coming down with a bit of a winter cold.  It's a bit rough, but so glad that it's not covid, we have been testing like crazy. At this point I feel like we are one of the few left who have not got it, we are also so crazy protecting ourselves from it for the sake of Rhiannons life!  There is no way she could survive it so we must do everything in our power to avoid it.  I think the hardest part is that the rest of the world is like   'eh its ok, nothing bad will happen', ya know what, at this point most of the rest of the world has had it at some point.
