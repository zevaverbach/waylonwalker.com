#### One on One time

Last night we made a long trip back from my In-Laws.  Which was a great day by the way.  Sometimes we struggle with Wyatt's energy in a house with lots of breakable items, but he did great yesterday.  When we got home Wyatt just finished up with a good two hour nap and was wired... at 11:00 PM.  He was hungry, as he was too excited to play while at grandmas house and did not eat much.  I sat up with him,  we shared a peanut butter sandwich and got out a new pack of trolls characters and worked on finding all of their names.

Moments like these do not seem to come often enough.  I really enjoy playing with the whole family and the full level of craziness that it brings, but having a calm one on one time with one member of the family seems extra special.  It was the perfect ending to a long day with lots of packing, travel, and excitement.
