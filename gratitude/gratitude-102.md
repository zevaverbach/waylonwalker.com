Today has been a day.  Ayla has been on some serious mood swings and doing some
very out of character activity.  At the end of the day we had a nice talk.  We
talked about how we both made some mistakes thoughout the day, everyone does
they are a part of life.  But we don't need to let those mistakes define how our
day goes, we get to choose if we continue down a good or bad path for the rest
of the day.

I am so grateful that after this talk we both had a much better night, we
understood the feelings that each other was processing and were able to really
turn our night around and have a much better time cooperating with each other
from there on out.
