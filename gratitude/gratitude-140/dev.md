HUGE SNOW DAY.  Today we got one of the biggest snows we have had since moving to Illinois nearly 10 years ago.  The one that feels close was the first year we were here, the day Becca came to see us in Minier we got dumped on.  I remember calling in that day and the response was well, if you don't think you can make it you can use a vacation day.... it was my first year and my very little vacation was pro-rated.  Oh what different times we are in now!

Rhiannon scooped the drive... well she hired it out.  I am so grateful for her doing that, because as I watched neighbors snowblow their driveways I realized how back breaking shoveling would have been.

While everyone else way blowing off their drives after work Wyatt and I were enjoying the fruits of Rhiannon's hard work.  We made a really awesome igloo in the pile of snow that turned into a tunnel through the pile.  He was super impressed and was had a ton of fun playing it.
