article_html: "<h4 id=\"calm\">Calm</h4>\n<p>On Thursday I got the call that Rhiannon
  had passes out during physical therapy.  I went right to her therapy office to find
  her rehydrating in a chair.  She seemed ok and that this would pass and be ok.  When
  trying to get up again she passed out.  Three days later we are back home from the
  hospital and she is still passing out.  All we know is that she has cancer and she
  is struggling to keep her blood pressure up while standing.  I am very grateful
  that we have the friends we have to take care of everything at home for us.  Most
  of all I am grateful that we are able to keep it calm and collected.  Too many folks
  get very worked up through these events and it is not productive.  Our job is to
  remain calm, stay focused on the things that we are able to do that help her, and
  let the doctors do their job.  We have enough doctors involved that if there was
  something to find, it would have been found.  I really hope that we can get her
  back on her feet where she is not passing out everytime that she stands up.  But
  for now, I am keeping my calm, staying positive, spending time with the kids, and
  doing the tasks that help us function through the day.</p>\n<div class='prevnext'>\n\n

#### Calm

On Thursday I got the call that Rhiannon had passes out during physical therapy.  I went right to her therapy office to find her rehydrating in a chair.  She seemed ok and that this would pass and be ok.  When trying to get up again she passed out.  Three days later we are back home from the hospital and she is still passing out.  All we know is that she has cancer and she is struggling to keep her blood pressure up while standing.  I am very grateful that we have the friends we have to take care of everything at home for us.  Most of all I am grateful that we are able to keep it calm and collected.  Too many folks get very worked up through these events and it is not productive.  Our job is to remain calm, stay focused on the things that we are able to do that help her, and let the doctors do their job.  We have enough doctors involved that if there was something to find, it would have been found.  I really hope that we can get her back on her feet where she is not passing out everytime that she stands up.  But for now, I am keeping my calm, staying positive, spending time with the kids, and doing the tasks that help us function through the day.
