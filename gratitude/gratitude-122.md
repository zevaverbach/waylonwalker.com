ðŸ˜¬ Today has been a bit nervewracking.  The sellers of our house are
MIA, and we are waiting for them to sign some documents.  We are getting
nervous that they are having second thoughts about the deal before it
gets finalized, but I'm sure they are just away from their devices for
personal reasons.

On a less nervewracking note, Wyatt and I played on our first Modded
minecraft server today.  He has been asking me for weeks to set it up
and we have just been swamped that I have just told him no lets just
focus on playing something that works.  It took over an hour, maybe two
to get all figured out and running, but we did it.  There was no guide
out there for Linux, and all the gui's are written for windows and not
working for me.  Everything felt like what I needed to do was
straightforward, but it I had to run the same command several
times over with different results to get going.  We had a blast, he was
just super pumped and trying to tell me all these things he knows about
modded minecraft.
