#### Bravery

Its not something that is handed out by participation.  Being part of the battle does not earn bravery.  Defeating the odds,  going into a battle with passion for the end result, and putting all of your heart into it.  Thats what defines bravery to me.  Last night I saw two family members give excelent examples of bravery.  Last night was the preschool prom night.  Ayla was unable to go, and Rhiannon was very passionate about going with Wyatt.  She has not been feeling well, and being around lots of poeple can make it very difficult at times, but she did it.  She was able to overcome the odds and make it through the prom for him. The other great example of bravery was Wyatt.  While in a very excited mood, with a lot going on around him.  He was able to stand by his mothers side, hold her hand, ask her if she was ok, and ask if there was anything he could do to help her through a rough spot.  He was able to overcome his ADHD, take a deep breath and stand strong for his mother.  This is not the first time that he has done this.  He has been growing up into a brave boy lately.
