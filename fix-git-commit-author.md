## Change the email for this repo

_stop the bleeding_

Before anything else set the email correctly!

``` bash
cd kedro
git config user.name "Waylon Walker"
git config user.email quadmx08@gmail.com
```

## Prepare for rebasing

First thing is to find how many commits back this mistake goes.  I opened up the git log, and saw mine went back 19 commits.  I rolled back 20 just to be sure.

``` bash
$ git log
...
commit a355926b9d7ec4c05659adaa254beefbdb036332
Author: WaylonWalker <email@work.com>

commit 1756f5d121bd06c459560b2e982e0d7b6879e9ca
Author: Kiyohito Kunii (Kiyo) <8097799+921kiyo@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 2 15:33:09 2020 +0100

    Fix docs reference for registering `pipelines`
```

## start the rebase

Now I start the rebase 20 commits back from HEAD.  THis will pop you into a text file with a list of commits, for this change simply replace all `pick` with `edit`.

``` bash
git rebase -i HEAD~20
```

## Note for the first commit

If you want to rebase back to the start of the repo use the `--root` flag.

``` bash
git rebase -i --root
```

Run git log to see where we ended up.

``` bash
$ git log
commit 1756f5d121bd06c459560b2e982e0d7b6879e9ca
Author: Kiyohito Kunii (Kiyo) <8097799+921kiyo@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 2 15:33:09 2020 +0100

    Fix docs reference for registering `pipelines`
```

As expected we ended up on Kiyo's commit. So we can simply move forward without any edits.

``` bash
$ git rebase --continue
Stopped at e162ca7...  correct function name in tests
You can amend the commit now, with

  git commit --amend

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

  git rebase --continue
```

## ðŸ›  Fix First wrong Commit

Checking the log again I an now on my first commit with a mistake.

``` bash
$ git log

Running the following command will reset the author on the current commit.

``` bash
git commit --amend --reset-author
```

Double check with a quick `git log` that the author was fixed.

## Fix all commits

Now to do this for 18 other commits.  I found that chaining the three commands into a bash one-liner was quite helpful.  I turned off pre-commit hooks with `--no-verify`.  I also turned off the `log` pager by adding `--no-pager`.

``` bash
git rebase --continue && \
git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit --no-verify && \
git --no-pager log -n 3
```

## Done

This was quick and easy for 19 commits.  I have tried to loop through changes like this in the past, and it does get a bit hairy.  I find its easier to just setup a one-liner and crank through them one by one.

## A note on changing history...

Since this was done in a rebase it has changed the history of the repo.  This is ok to do only when you are the only person or are in close communication with everyone using the repo.  One thing I have ran into is that if you do this after you submit a PR, but before its completed it duplicates your commits in a merge.  For this particular change I simply closed the first PR and opened a second.  If someone has a better suggestion, I would be glad to know a better way.

## ReCap

``` bash
cd kedro
git config user.name "Waylon Walker"
git config user.email quadmx08@gmail.com
git log
git rebase -i HEAD~20
git log
git rebase --continue
git log
git rebase --continue && git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit --no-verify && git --no-pager log -n 3
```
