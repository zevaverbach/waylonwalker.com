It was so easy to get a professional looking navbar with just 3 lines of code.
This package seriously is so usable on mobile it is ridiculous.  I found this
package from
[day-4](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/react-component/?utm_campaign=100%20Days%20of%20Gatsby&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=82376619&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_DBh1A1A-GEy2TujddXq_H1de5wGZ_X6jIqB2wv_PE7QgUk40pfi64jbSVHv-S3bfzKZOQywtoTuup2aeO0o_KpeiF8w&_hsmi=82376619)
of the 100 days of gatsby challenge.  It is by the wonderful man who brought us
gatsbyjs Kyle Mathews, so you know its gotta be good.

## install react-headroom

installation is easy

``` bash
npm i react-headroom
```

## Import Headroom

There was no instructions for es6 style imports that are common with gatsbyjs
sites like mine, but it was intuitive to figure out.

``` js
import Headroom from 'react-headroom'
```

## Using Headroom

Simply wrap your existing content, Nav in my case, with the `<Headroom />`
component and your off to the races.  The content will pop back into view when
you scroll past then back up.

``` html
<Headroom>
   <-- Your content goes here -->
</Headroom>
```

## See it in action

I think this simple package completely changes the ux of your site on mobile.
You can get that sticky nav out of the way, but its still right there with just
a little bit of a scroll up.

## Configurable

`react-headroom` is configurable, but I did not find it necessary.  I really
like the simplicity that it brought by just adding the `<Headroom\>` component.
