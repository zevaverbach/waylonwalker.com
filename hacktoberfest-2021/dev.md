Are you participating in Hacktoberfest 2021?


I got my start with open source with Hacktoberfest 2018.  I remember being so nervous for those first pr's.  I have continued to participate every year, and it feels good to give back.


## It made a big change on me

Something that it really did for me was to lower the hurdle to contribute regularly.  I am not a huge contributor to open source.  I am not necessarily a regular maintainer of any large project, but I do often raise issues when I see things as a user that would make things easier or more clear.

After participating it does not feel like such a big deal to go through the motions of making my own fork, making a small change, and submitting it for review.

## What can you do?

As a user, you might be in a unique position to see a library from the perspective of other users rather than from the eyes of a maintainer.  You can help bring the user perspective to your favorite library.

My favorite error messages are those that I helped tweak just a bit to make it clear to the user what is happening and how to fix it.  As much as we all hate getting errors, It does warm my heart when I see one that I helped make better.
