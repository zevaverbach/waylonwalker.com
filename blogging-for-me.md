I create this blog with one person in mind, me.

## There are others like me

This is not completely selfish, as there are likely many others out there that
think similarly to me.  Everyone comes from different backgrounds and varying
levels of experience.  In no way do you need to be an expert to create content
others will benefit from.

## Accurate

I am as accurate as possible.  I don't know everything, and If I waited for
that to happen I would never post, or write at such a high level no one else
(including me) would ever want to read.

Generally I know that I am directionally accurate for most of the article.  In
fact there is often a part of the article that I don't feel the best about.  It
may have been some code that could have been better.  I try to point these
things out.  Often when I am and point out where I know there is
improvement to be had I get the most welcoming comments, "that was just fine
how you did that", or "I tried that myself and saw a better abstraction.

## Create the articles I want to read

Generally the articles I want to read are directly relatable to things I am
currently working on and vary over time.  Over the last year its been leaning a
bit more towards automation with
[bash](https://waylonwalker.com/linux/),
[python](https://waylonwalker.com/python/),
[kedro](https://waylonwalker.com/kedro/) tools.

## On Brand

I try to stay on brand to who I am.  I remember writing my first articles.  I
was trying to be whitty, and include funny memes.  Thats not me.  I am not a
commedian, and generally memes go right over my head.  I can remember back in
High School, I was the one that didn't understand a lot of pop culture and was
kinda treated as if I was always living under a rock.  I knew it was true and I
owned it, so no one ever got too mean about it.

## Honest, never fake

I will not try to pretend that I know everything.  You may read my blog on
occasion and think I know a lot, also possible that you think "wow what an
idiot".  I welcome you to share your thoughts and techniques in a positive way.
I often cringe at some of my old posts and think about how differently I would
approach something not that long after posting.  I honest, never fake know what
I need to know and don't pretend to know anything outside of my wheelhouse.
