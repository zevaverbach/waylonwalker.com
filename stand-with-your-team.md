People who are quick to toss team members under a bus are not well trusted or
highly thought of and it will lead to some toxic team dynamics.

## Building Steam

While collaborating on any project there are going to be decisions made that
aren't necessarily your favorite, during a summer internship my mentor made
some decisions that I was not on board with, but I accepted his wisdom and
moved forward with little push back.

## Full Spead Ahead

During a review, leadership showed interest in the option that I wanted to go
towards.  I was quick to jump up and say I  told you so right then and there
and pitch reasons why my idea was so much better.

## The Aftermath

I walked out so **proud** that leadership recognized my idea, but I will never
forget the look on my teammate's face and what he told me after the meeting.

> "Wow quick to throw me under the bus in front of everyone ðŸ˜¢".   I

~ my teammate

## Realizing what Happened

It was at this moment that I threw my mentor, a good **friend** in front of a
bus that was at full speed.  I will never forget this moment and the importance
of being a good trustworthy team player.

## Speak your Mind, be heard, shut up

This day I learned that there is a time to speak your mind.  While that bus is
sitting idle it would have hurt no one.

---

There were times to hear out ideas, and there were times that we need to accept
the decisions the team made.  The team that you were a part of and had a chance
to steer.

---

There are times where it's appropriate to sit down and shut up.

## Your Story ðŸ‘‡

Do you have a story of how not standing with your team caused you pain later
on.  I would love to hear and learn from your experience.
